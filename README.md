Is your experience playing Minecraft too _slow_&thinsp;? Do you find riding _ice-boat nether highways_ boring? Would you like to _\*feel\*_ like you're moving faster without actually moving faster? If so, take a look at this!\*

<sup> *Effect is exaggerated in the demo—it's slightly less obtrusive in-game! Shaders used in demo are [Complementary Shaders](https://www.complementary.dev).</sup><p></p>

## Features
...This mod is basically built around a single shader I made (lol), but care has been taken to change how the effect interacts with the game environment beyond speed scaling—specifically:

* **Opacity Modulation** *(the opacity of the effect is adjusted based on the brightness of the current image).*
	* This results in a uniform contrast in different environments (e.g., day vs night) reducing obtrusiveness.
- **Velocity Correction** *(effect takes into account the difference between the direction of velocity and camera direction).*
	- While not perfect, it mitigates the issue of moving in a direction that is not forward (e.g., looking sideways on a forward moving boat).

Originally, I made this mod just to learn/practice glsl, but I figured some may find it fun to use. If you have any suggestions, please let me know!
